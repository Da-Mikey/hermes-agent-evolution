"""Verify no fork feature was silently dropped by an upstream sync.

The fork's features are additive edits *inside* otherwise-upstream files, so a
plain diff against upstream is mostly noise. This checks the two things that
are actually machine-checkable:

1. **Fork-only issue markers.** Every fork feature carries an issue reference
   (``#1234``) in the code that implements it. Markers that appear in the fork
   tree but not in the upstream tree are fork-owned; every one of them must
   survive a sync.
2. **Fork-only files.** Files that exist in the fork and not upstream must not
   be deleted by a merge.

Both baselines are computed from git refs rather than a checked-in snapshot, so
the check cannot silently drift out of date.

Usage::

    # before syncing — record what the fork owns
    python3 scripts/verify_fork_features.py snapshot \\
        --fork origin/main --upstream upstream/main -o .evolution/fork-baseline.json

    # after each merge step — confirm nothing vanished
    python3 scripts/verify_fork_features.py check \\
        --baseline .evolution/fork-baseline.json

Exit code is 1 when anything is missing, so it can gate a sync branch in CI.
