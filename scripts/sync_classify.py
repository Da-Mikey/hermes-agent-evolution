"""Classify a test that vanished during an upstream sync: whose work was it?

The obvious rule — "present at the merge-base, so upstream authored it, so
accepting upstream's deletion is safe" — has a failure mode that silently drops
fork work:

    the test exists at the merge-base, the FORK then modifies it, and upstream
    later deletes it.

Under the obvious rule that reads as a clean upstream deletion, and the fork's
modification goes with it. Catching this needs the base -> fork diff, not just
membership in the base. This script reports that diff for every test that is in
both the base and the fork but absent from the working tree, so each one is
decided on evidence rather than on a name lookup.

    python3 scripts/sync_classify.py --base v2026.7.20 --fork origin/main tests/

Verdicts:

  FORK-AUTHORED     absent from the base entirely — the fork wrote it, restore.
  FORK-MODIFIED     in the base, but the fork changed it — read the diff. A
                    ruff-format reflow carries no intent and follows upstream's
                    deletion; a changed assertion or a new comment does.
  UPSTREAM-ONLY     byte-identical to the base — upstream authored and deleted
                    it, accept the deletion.
