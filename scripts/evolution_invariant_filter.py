"""Immutable invariant filter for forge rewrites (issue #68, slices 1+2).

Screens every skill/prompt/harness rewrite against a versioned set of
Cerberus/household constraints BEFORE it reaches the judge. A rewrite that
violates any hard invariant is short-circuited at zero fitness — it never
reaches evaluation or application. This is the "cannot violate" floor that
complements the existing verifier-gated edits (SIA) and the prompt-injection
scan (#1808).

Slices shipped here:

  * **Slice 1** — the constraint set lives as DATA in
    ``evolution_invariant_rules.json`` (a versioned, human-readable file), so
    the rules are reviewable, diffable, and extensible without touching code.
  * **Slice 2** — this deterministic filter loads that data and screens a
    rewrite dict against it. Wired into ``evolution_harness_gate.run_gate`` and
    ``run_cron_pass`` so a violating harness proposal is rejected with
    ``zero_fitness`` before the sandbox/regression gate ever runs.
  * **Slice 3** (staged rollout) — ``classify_stakes`` buckets a proposal into
    low/medium/high from its explicit ``stakes`` field (else its target path).
    Each rule may declare an ``enforce_at`` floor; below that floor a finding is
    demoted to ADVISORY instead of blocking. A rule with no ``enforce_at``
    defaults to high and blocks everything (unchanged behavior), so a new strict
    rule can be rolled out staged — advisory on high-stakes targets first,
    blocking on low-stakes ones — with zero behavior change for existing rules.
  * **Slice 4** (pinned safe-fallback set) — ``load_safe_fallbacks`` /
    ``resolve_pinned_fallback`` expose a versioned ``safe_fallbacks`` set of
    human-vetted, pinned alternative targets. When a proposal is blocked on a
    forbidden path that has a pinned fallback, the filter attaches
    ``safe_fallback`` to the result so the rejection is actionable, not a dead
    end. Additive: a rules file that predates slice 4 simply yields no fallbacks.

The filter is deliberately CONSERVATIVE: it catches only unambiguous
violations (low false-positive floor), and it checks only top-level scalar
fields of a rewrite dict. It is a deterministic floor, not a semantic judge —
the LLM judge still does the open-ended evaluation; this module just vetoes
the candidates that must never get that far.

Design mirrors the other ``scripts/evolution_*.py`` helpers: pure, typed,
import-safe functions + a thin CLI. No LLM, no network, no clock, no IO beyond
reading the rules file.

CLI:

    evolution_invariant_filter.py proposal.json
    cat proposal.json | evolution_invariant_filter.py

Prints one JSON object ``{"ok", "violations", ...}`` and exits 0 when the
rewrite passes every invariant, 1 when it violates one — so a shell caller can
short-circuit on ``$?`` before invoking the judge.
