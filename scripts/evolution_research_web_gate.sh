# Evolution research web-health preflight gate (issue #108).
#
# WHY: the research stage's web path can be dead (firecrawl HTTP 402 / MCP
# circuit-break, DNS outage, quota exhaustion) with no health gate at stage
# start. A dead web surface left the stage free to emit a plausible-looking
# report — or, at best, rely on manual discipline to admit it was blocked.
#
# HOW: probe a few cheap, independent endpoints (the research feeds' hosts).
#   - All probes fail  -> write a BLOCKED report + a degraded flag, then
#                        print {"wakeAgent": false} so no LLM tokens are spent
#                        and no plausible-looking findings can be fabricated.
#   - Any probe works  -> clear the degraded flag and fall through to the
#                        standard write-access gate (evolution_access_gate.sh),
#                        which owns the final wake decision.
#
# The scheduler's wake-gate contract: the LAST stdout line must be the JSON.
# We always exit 0 so the printed JSON — not the exit code — is the single
# source of truth (a nonzero exit would wake the agent unconditionally).

**Status: BLOCKED — web surface unreachable at research-stage start (issue #108).**

The web-health preflight failed for every probed endpoint at $STAMP:
- https://arxiv.org — FAIL
- https://huggingface.co — FAIL
- https://duckduckgo.com — FAIL

No research was attempted and no findings were produced. The degraded flag
(\`$FLAG\`) records this cycle as web-degraded so sibling stages know there is
no fresh web-derived signal. Retry at the next scheduled slot; do NOT consume
stale or fabricated findings from this cycle.
