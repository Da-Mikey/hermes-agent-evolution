"""Immutable-hash registry for long-lived prompt/state files (#98).

Self-propagating payloads ("mind viruses", Anthropic/EPFL Aug 2026) persist by
writing instructions into long-lived prompt/state files — SOUL.md, MEMORY.md,
USER.md — which the next agent then re-reads as directives.  The standing
``UNTRUSTED_CONTENT_GUIDANCE`` clause teaches the agent to treat that content
as data; this module adds the complementary *detection* half: a SHA-256
registry of those files that alerts when one drifts from its baseline.

Deliberately small, fail-open, and side-effect-minimal:

* ``verify_integrity`` never raises for operational reasons (missing or corrupt
  registry, unreadable files) — it returns a report the caller can log.
* Content is treated strictly as DATA: files are hashed, never parsed or
  executed, so an embedded payload can never influence this module's behavior.
* The registry lives under ``<home>/integrity/prompt_files.sha256.json``; the
  first run establishes the baseline, subsequent runs compare against it.
