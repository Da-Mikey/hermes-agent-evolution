"""Contradiction detection for episodic memory (issue #37).

The memory-management research behind #37 identifies contradiction handling as
a core write-path operation: when a new observation conflicts with a stored
memory, the system must *surface* both (with timestamps) rather than silently
overwrite or accumulate noise. This module implements that operation for the
episodic tier (``agent.memory_importance.EpisodicMemoryStore``) with
deterministic, LLM-free heuristics:

1. **Negation flip on a shared subject** — if a new observation asserts
   ``<subject> is X`` while a stored event asserts ``<subject> is not X``
   (or vice versa), that is a contradiction. Detected by comparing negation
   polarity between the two texts when they share at least one content token
   (the subject).

The detector is deliberately conservative to keep false positives low: it
requires (a) at least two shared content tokens (subject + claim tokens, so
a common predicate alone never triggers), and (b) exactly one side carrying
a negation marker. Texts that merely differ (no shared subject) never flag.

Stdlib-only and import-safe, consistent with
:mod:`agent.memory_importance`. The real call site is
``MemoryManager.score_memories`` in :mod:`agent.memory_manager` — every
scored turn is checked against the recent episodic store and flags are
logged (never silently dropped).
