"""Tests for :mod:`agent.memory_contradiction` (issue #37).

Covers the negation-flip heuristic: contradictions are flagged when a new
observation and a stored event share a subject but disagree on polarity,
and — just as important — non-contradictions (no shared subject, same
polarity, empty input) never flag. Also covers the real call-site wiring
in :class:`agent.memory_manager.MemoryManager`: scoring a turn that
contradicts an existing episodic event surfaces a flag, and the flag is
logged rather than crashing or deleting anything.
