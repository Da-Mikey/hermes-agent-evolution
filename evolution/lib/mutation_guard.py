"""Mutating-step safety: snapshot-before-destructive primitive + failure-cause counter (#3014, #2995).

Implements the SABER / Do-over mutating-step safety pattern:
1. FileSnapshot: snapshot target files before executing a destructive or
   mutating command, with automatic or explicit rollback capabilities.
2. MutatingFailureCounter: record how often a failed run's root cause was a
   mutating step and surface the share for realized-impact metrics.

Pure standard library only, thread-safe, no side effects on import.
