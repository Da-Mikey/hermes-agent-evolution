"""Non-stationary audit bar — the Red-Queen rising audit standard (issue #63).

A frozen audit standard stalls a self-improving system: once an audit has
"accepted" the current state, an unchanged checklist keeps re-confirming it
while new drift slips past (the Red Queen Gödel Machine, arXiv 2606.26294:
the bar must rise as the agent improves).  This module makes the audit bar
non-stationary with four mechanisms:

* **Calibration traps** — the previous audit's accepted observations are
  carried forward into the next audit's prompt as KNOWN/ACCEPTED entries.
  The auditor must (a) recognise each trap as known — never re-report it as
  new drift — and (b) still identify NEW drift that no trap covers.
* **Miss counting** — each audit where drift occurred but the auditor
  reported nothing increments a consecutive-miss counter.
* **Rubric rotation** — when the miss counter crosses a configurable
  threshold, the audit rubric (the checklist/prompt variant the auditor is
  told to walk) rotates to the next variant and the counter resets: the bar
  rises, the standard is no longer frozen.
* **Persisted state** — accepted observations, miss count, and the active
  rubric variant live in a JSON state file under the evolution dir, the same
  convention as the watchdog's alert state and the rubric-forge sidecars
  (fail-open on read, best-effort atomic write).

Pure engine + explicit IO, mirroring the repo's other evolution lib modules
(``rubric_forge``, ``rubric_heldout_gate``): every rule is a pure function
unit-testable without touching the disk; ``load_state`` / ``save_state`` /
``state_file_path`` are the only IO.

   demoted; a demotion stamp on a redundant or high-utility skill is drift.
3. STALENESS — a verdict that has not changed while the corpus moved (a
   frozen standard stops catching drift) is itself a finding.
4. TRAP ACKNOWLEDGEMENT — list every calibration trap by id as KNOWN before
   reporting anything new; missing acknowledgement is a quality flag.
